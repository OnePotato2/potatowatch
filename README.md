This is a simple project for my own, ridiculous amusement, and benefit.  This directly pushes into https://potatowatch.afront.org

Forks + PRs are fine, but there are rules:

1. One must not explain, or show, what Potato is, you may elude, BADLY, but you must not explain what's going on here
2. I will be quite cross if you break rule #1
